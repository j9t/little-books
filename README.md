# The Little Book of Little Books: HTML and CSS Frameworks, Coding Guidelines, Quality Control

This is the source of _The Little Book of Little Books_.

Official description:

> _The Little Book of Little Books_ consists of three booklets, originally released in 2015 and 2016, that on request by the author and with permission and release by the former publisher, [Oâ€™Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/), have been lightly updated and edited:
> 
> _The Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks_ (2015) provides guidance for the development as well as the use of web frameworks. While times have changed, itâ€™s the authorâ€™s conviction that the principles outlined in the book still hold, and that the book provides unique views for the benefit of everyone working with frameworks. 
> 
> _The Little Book of HTML/CSS Coding Guidelines_ (2015) outlines the benefits of coding standards, and discusses them on the basis of the [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html). The author, having driven the effort to revise and publish the Google guidelines back in 2012, maintains that the modern frontend developer and their craft still benefit from such standards. 
>  
> _The Little Book of Website Quality Control_ (2016) glosses over quality assurance and control and offers a comprehensive collection of tools. The author believes that this has been one of his weakest books, ponders why he didnâ€™t do better, but likes the idea that over time, he can make updates to it that make it a little less bad.
>
> ðŸ‘‰ This is the book if you want to travel back in time for a different perspective on frameworks, coding guidelines, and quality control.
